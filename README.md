**Welcome!** 

This code follows the tutorial from ACS_1320. We are trying to create the game Break Out. If you would like to try this tutorial, you can find it [here].

**Update from January 30, 2025**
After creating the game Break Out following the tutorial given, we are trying to improve the quality of code by incorporating Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in this JavaScript code.

Thank you! Enjoy!
